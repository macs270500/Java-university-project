# Java-university-project
This java project aim is to build a point of sales application (similar to system found at supermarket counters) for a business that had no automation in place.
The system keeps track of the products sold, amount of a product left in inventory and generates a receipt for the system to print to hand out to the client.

To be able to use the system, a database with tables admin, products and soldproducts must be created. Then the path must be specified in the dbConnection class.
